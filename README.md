# Deep Learning Projects Repository  

Welcome to the **Deep Learning Projects Repository**! This repository contains a collection of deep learning projects designed to showcase practical implementations of machine learning techniques, neural networks, and data analysis. Each project explores different aspects of deep learning, from image classification to advanced model optimization.

### **Project Highlights**

#### 1. **Dogs vs. Cats Classification**
- A convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images of dogs and cats.
- **Features**:
  - Data preprocessing with TensorFlow's `image_dataset_from_directory`.
  - Model optimization using Batch Normalization, Dropout, and L2 regularization.
  - Multiple CNN architectures with training, evaluation, and visualization of performance metrics.

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed along with the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
